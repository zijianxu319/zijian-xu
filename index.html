    <h2>Technical Interests</h2>
    <p>I have a strong interest in big data, especially in big data prediction and analysis. As data continues to grow exponentially, I am fascinated by how machine learning and predictive analytics can harness that data to create meaningful insights. I aim to gain hands-on experience in this field through learning and practical projects, exploring tools and algorithms for data processing, and understanding how big data can influence decision-making in business and technology.</p>
